Initial Implementation Notes

- Auth screens scaffolded (sign in/up/reset) pending backend integration.
- Material 3 theme, Google Fonts, light/dark mode.

Next Engineering Phases

- Phase 1 (Auth & Basics): Integrate Firebase Auth (email/password, Google), user profile storage; introduce app-wide auth state guarding routes; local persistence with SharedPreferences; push notifications (FCM) baseline.
- Phase 2 (Classes): Backend API for schedule, filtering, booking, cancellations, waitlist; offline cache; QR check-in.
- Phase 3 (Membership & Payments): Plans, purchase flow (Stripe), billing history.
- Phase 4 (Activity & Nutrition): Workout tracking, progress dashboards; nutrition diary; optional HealthKit/Google Fit integration.
- Phase 5 (Quality): Accessibility pass, performance targets, CI/CD, analytics/crash reporting, test coverage.
